# AVS Codes (auth_avs_code)
#
# An issuing bank uses the AVS code to confirm that your customer is providing the correct
# billing address. If the customer provides incorrect data, the transaction might be
# fraudulent.
#
# NB: When you populate billing street address 1 and billing street address 2,
# CyberSource through VisaNet concatenates the two values. If the
# concatenated value exceeds 40 characters, CyberSource through VisaNet
# truncates the value at 40 characters before sending it to Visa and the issuing
# bank. Truncating this value affects AVS results and therefore might also affect
# risk decisions and chargebacks.
